***notice***:In order to improve the quality of the training sets, we used drug similarity scores and path-binding based methods to screen high-quality negative samples, and then combined with experimentally verified positive samples.<br>
1.	***getFinalNS_1path*** /: Score results were obtained for all potential negative samples calculated based on drug similarity scores.
2.	***getFinalNS_2path*** /: Obtain the path weight value of target drug path length of 2 in potential negative samples.
3.	***4_add1path.py***: The final score of the potential drug-disease pair is obtained by adding the result file generated by "getFinalNS_1path" to the result file generated by "getFinalNS_2path".
4.	***5_getFinalSamples.py***: High-quality negative samples were screened according to different proportions of positive and negative samples and different scoring thresholds.<br>
