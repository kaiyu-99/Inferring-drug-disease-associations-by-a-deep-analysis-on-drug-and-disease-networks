1.	***example_1*** / :This document mainly takes 10 drugs as examples, constructs the small drug matrix, combines with potential negative samples, and finally calculates the score and sum of related drug similarity. <br>
2.	***1_getValue.py***: The drug fingerprint was represented by 0 and 1 vectors, and the similarity between the two drugs was calculated by tanimoto coefficient.<br>
3.	***2_createMatrix.py***: Drug similarity matrix was generated by drugs and its similarity score. <br>
4.	***3_nsResults.py***ï¼šThe scores of potential negative samples was calculated by drug similarity matrix and potential negative samples.
