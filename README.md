# Inferring drug disease associations by a deep analysis on drug and disease networks
### Functions:
In this study, a novel reliable negative sample selection scheme is presented, which can screen out reliable pairs of drugs and diseases with low probabilities to be actual drug-disease associations. This scheme considers k-neighbors of one drug in a drug network and sets up a scoring system to evaluate the pairs of this drug and diseases. The cross-validation results suggest that classifiers using this scheme provide nearly perfect performance and are significantly superior to those using traditional negative sample selection schemes.<br>
