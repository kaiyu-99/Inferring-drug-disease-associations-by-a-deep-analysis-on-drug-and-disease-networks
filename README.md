# Inferring-drug-disease-associations-by-a-deep-analysis-on-drug-and-disease-networks
### Functions:
 In this study, we proposed a new method for in-depth analysis of drug and disease networks to infer drug and disease associations in order to improve the
 performance of drug repositioning studies. First, a novel method is used to screen reliable negative samples, combine high-quality negative samples with
 experimentally verified positive samples, and then construct drug networks and disease networks, which are fed into a powerful Mashup network embedding algorithm
 to extract rich drug and network characteristics. Then, three classical classification algorithms are used to build models. The results indicated that all classifiers
 achieve significant performance improvement based on the use of high-quality negative samples, so this method can effectively improve the performance of drug-disease
 association prediction. In addition, compared with BN and NNA classification algorithms, the network model constructed by RF classification algorithm has better
 performance in identifying drug-disease associations.<br>
